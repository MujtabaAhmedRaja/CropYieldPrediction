# CropYieldPrediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting crop yield based on various factors such as historical weather data, soil conditions, and fertilizer usage. By accurately forecasting crop yields, farmers can make informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and resource allocation.
