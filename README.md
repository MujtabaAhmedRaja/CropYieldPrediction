# Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting crop yield based on various factors such as historical weather data, soil conditions, and fertilizer usage. By accurately forecasting crop yields, farmers can make informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and resource allocation.
Model Approach

> **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
Gather historical data on weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, humidity), soil properties (pH, nutrient levels), fertilizer application, and crop yield.
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Feature engineering: Create relevant features from the raw data, such as seasonal patterns, soil moisture indices, and fertilizer ratios.

> **Model Selection and Training:**
Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including:
Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression,XGBRegressor,Elastic Net)
Train the selected model on the preprocessed data, optimizing hyperparameters for better performance.

> **Potential Applications:**
Precision Agriculture: Optimize resource usage (water, fertilizer, pesticides) to maximize yield and minimize environmental impact.
Risk Management: Assess potential risks and uncertainties in crop production, enabling farmers to make informed decisions.
Policy Making: Support policymakers in developing effective agricultural policies and strategies.

> **Future Work:**
Incorporate additional data sources, such as satellite imagery and real-time sensor data, to improve prediction accuracy.
Develop more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, to capture complex patterns in the data.
Explore uncertainty quantification methods to provide confidence intervals for yield predictions.
Create a user-friendly web application with interactive visualizations to help farmers interpret the model's output.
